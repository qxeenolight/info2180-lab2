        <h2>First Week of University</h2>

        <p class="blog">There were about twenty people on the dam. Most of them were simply walking and
          getting exercise. There were a few who were fishing. There was a family who had
          laid down a blanket and they were having a picnic. It was like this most days
          and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The problem was that nobody noticed the
          water leaking through the dam wall.

        <p class="blog">I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall
          walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at
          noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of
          my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and
          reverberated by the angry echoes.

        <p class="blog">It was always the Monday mornings. It never seemed to happen on Tuesday morning,
          Wednesday morning, or any other morning during the week. But it happened every
          Monday morning like clockwork. He mentally prepared himself to once again deal
          with what was about to happen, but this time he also placed a knife in his pocket
          just in case.

        <p class="blog">Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house.
          The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the
          pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that
          they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in
          advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait
          for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.
